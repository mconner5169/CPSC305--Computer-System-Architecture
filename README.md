# CPSC305--Computer-System-Architecture

This class's objectives were:
To learn computer systems and architecture - memory, memory hierarchy, CPU, registers, ALU, fetch-execute, buses, and more.

To obtain a high-level understanding of the successive layers that comprise a physical computing system, and how they interact with one another to ultimately provide an application level solution.

To gain experience building simple but representative components at each of the fundamental levels: electronic components, digital design, computer organization, machine language, assembly language, and C.

To learn the principles of electronics that form the basis of all computing equipment.
